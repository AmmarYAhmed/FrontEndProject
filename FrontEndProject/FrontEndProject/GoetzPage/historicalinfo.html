                    THE GOETZ THEATRE is located at the southeast corner of the Historic Downtown Square in Monroe, Wisconsin, at 1704 11th Street and is open every day of the year.
                    The GOETZ THEATRE features three theatres with Digital Projection.
                    The Historic Goetz Theatre(Auditorium 1) opened on September 2, 1931.
                    It was built during the great depression and had its historic facade totally reconstructed during the fall of 2006.
                    This auditorium seats over 350 people with Massey rocking chair seats, down from its original 1000 seats, maintaining much of its historic beginnings, along with Digital Projection and the newest in high reflective screens.
                </p>
                <p>
                    GOETZ 2 opened in 1981 and was completely renovated spring 2007 then reopened 24 May featuring “Pirates of the Caribbean.” Its new entry, allowing this auditorium to feature stadium seating, is “through the historic wall” of the inner lobby of the Goetz Theatre. The entry door completely matches the stucco wall it goes through. Digital Projection is also featured here along with a new screen, bright orange rocking seats, blue walls and floor with bright green trim and safety rails.



                    GOETZ 3 opened  14 December 1994, with “Star Trek” and features Digital Projection with a sound that really rocks. This sound system, the first of our three sound systems that we designed and built ourselves, was designed to match this auditorium and to which the other two theatres’ sound systems were based.  The very first belt driven projector in Wisconsin was featured  here and now stands in our lobby, whereas all others were gear driven.



                    G1, G2 & G3 all feature the newest in DIGITAL PROJECTION equipment for sight and sound.
